The ultimate aim is computerise all of the centre’s records and processes this includes, but is not limited to, the booking of experiences, the logging of volunteer detail and the keeping of zoo and inoculation records. The second half of the project is to build and market a downloadable mobile app that will give centre visitors guided tours and further information on the animals that can be controlled from the CRM system. Therefore the final abstract for the project is outlined as:

“To design and build a CRM system that will be tailored to the day to running of a zoo or wildlife centre and to design, build and market a mobile application that will act as a guided tour around the centre that can be driven by the CRM system.”
